This project is a demo of retrainning the head classifier of ImageNet pretrained model on CIFAR-100 dataset. 

Download pre-trained modelï¼š [https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-5c106cde.pth] and save it as `pretrained_model/resnet18-5c106cde.pth`

In "scripts" folder, you can directly run the "train.sh" to train the model. The dataset will be downloaded automatically. And for more options, please refer to "train_head_classifier.py".
